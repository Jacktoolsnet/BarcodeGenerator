By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to&#10;guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the&#10;software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to&#10;most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose&#10;authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is&#10;covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to&#10;your programs, too.&#10;&#10;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our&#10;General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to&#10;distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),&#10;that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change&#10;the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you&#10;can do these things.&#10;&#10;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny&#10;you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions&#10;translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the&#10;software, or if you modify it.&#10;&#10;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for&#10;a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must&#10;make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must&#10;show them these terms so they know their rights.&#10;&#10;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)&#10;offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute&#10;and/or modify the software.&#10;&#10;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that&#10;everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the&#10;software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to&#10;know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced&#10;by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&#10;&#10;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We&#10;wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will&#10;individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.&#10;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for&#10;everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&#10;&#10;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification&#10;follow.&#10;&#10;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#10;&#10;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice&#10;placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#10;this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program&#10;or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any&#10;derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the&#10;Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or&#10;translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included&#10;without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as&#10;&quot;you&quot;.&#10;&#10;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by&#10;this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is&#10;not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents&#10;constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by&#10;running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#10;&#10;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as&#10;you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#10;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#10;disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License&#10;and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the&#10;Program a copy of this License along with the Program.&#10;&#10;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may&#10;at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#10;&#10;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus&#10;forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications&#10;or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of&#10;these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating&#10;    that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#10;&#10;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or&#10;    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be&#10;    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of&#10;    this License.&#10;&#10;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,&#10;    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the&#10;    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an&#10;    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or&#10;    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute&#10;    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy&#10;    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does&#10;    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is&#10;    not required to print an announcement.)&#10;&#10;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable&#10;sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably&#10;considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and&#10;its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate&#10;works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a&#10;work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms&#10;of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#10;whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#10;&#10;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your&#10;rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the&#10;right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on&#10;the Program.&#10;&#10;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the&#10;Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or&#10;distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this&#10;License.&#10;&#10;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under&#10;Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and&#10;2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source&#10;    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#10;    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to&#10;    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically&#10;    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the&#10;    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1&#10;    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to&#10;    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only&#10;    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in&#10;    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with&#10;    Subsection b above.)&#10;&#10;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making&#10;modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all&#10;the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface&#10;definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation&#10;of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code&#10;distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either&#10;source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#10;of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#10;itself accompanies the executable.&#10;&#10;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy&#10;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source&#10;code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though&#10;third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#10;&#10;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as&#10;expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,&#10;sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate&#10;your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or&#10;rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so&#10;long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&#10;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program&#10;or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not&#10;accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or&#10;any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to&#10;do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#10;the Program or works based on it.&#10;&#10;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),&#10;the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to&#10;copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.&#10;You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the&#10;rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by&#10;third parties to this License.&#10;&#10;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#10;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions&#10;are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that&#10;contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the&#10;conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#10;simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent&#10;obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.&#10;For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution&#10;of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through&#10;you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#10;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#10;&#10;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#10;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and&#10;the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or&#10;other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this&#10;section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software&#10;distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many&#10;people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software&#10;distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#10;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to&#10;distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that&#10;choice.&#10;&#10;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a&#10;consequence of the rest of this License.&#10;&#10;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain&#10;countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original&#10;copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit&#10;geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that&#10;distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In&#10;such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body&#10;of this License.&#10;&#10;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#10;General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in&#10;spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems&#10;or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#10;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later&#10;version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of&#10;that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may&#10;choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;&#10;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs&#10;whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for&#10;permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#10;write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&#10;Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of&#10;all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of&#10;software generally.&#10;&#10;NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR&#10;THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE&#10;STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE&#10;PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,&#10;INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND&#10;FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND&#10;PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,&#10;YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL&#10;ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE&#10;PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#10;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#10;INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA&#10;BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#10;FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER&#10;OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#10;&#10;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible&#10;use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software&#10;which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#10;&#10;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach&#10;them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion&#10;of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a&#10;pointer to where the full notice is found.&#10;&#10;    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&#10;&#10;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;&#10;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it&#10;    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free&#10;    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)&#10;    any later version.&#10;&#10;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT&#10;    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or&#10;    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for&#10;    more details.&#10;&#10;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#10;    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59&#10;    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA&#10;&#10;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#10;&#10;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it&#10;starts in an interactive mode:&#10;&#10;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes&#10;    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free&#10;    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;&#10;    type 'show c' for details.&#10;&#10;The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate&#10;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be&#10;called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be&#10;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#10;&#10;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,&#10;if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.  Here&#10;is a sample; alter the names:&#10;&#10;    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#10;    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#10;&#10;    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989&#10;&#10;    Ty Coon, President of Vice&#10;&#10;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#10;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#10;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#10;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public&#10;License instead of this License.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;CLASSPATH&quot; EXCEPTION TO THE GPL&#10;&#10;Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are&#10;subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but&#10;only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header&#10;the words &quot;Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the &quot;Classpath&quot;&#10;exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making&#10;    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of&#10;    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.&#10;&#10;    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you&#10;    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an&#10;    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,&#10;    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your&#10;    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,&#10;    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent&#10;    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If&#10;    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of&#10;    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do&#10;    so, delete this exception statement from your version.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING&#10;&#10;Certain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are&#10;subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,&#10;based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the&#10;GNU Classpath Exception.&#10;&#10;Note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software&#10;package.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed&#10;incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.&#10;For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache&#10;License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed&#10;to you under their original licenses.&#10;&#10;Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the&#10;Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits&#10;you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not&#10;licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to&#10;commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed&#10;code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also&#10;containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.&#10;&#10;Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the&#10;files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be&#10;required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under&#10;the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms&#10;of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath&#10;Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further&#10;distribute the package.&#10;&#10;Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create&#10;unexpected legal consequences.&#10;&#10;Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer&#10;skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or&#10;making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed&#10;and/or involve the use of third party software." wrapText="true" VBox.vgrow="ALWAYS" />

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to&#10;guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the&#10;software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to&#10;most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose&#10;authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is&#10;covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to&#10;your programs, too.&#10;&#10;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our&#10;General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to&#10;distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),&#10;that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change&#10;the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you&#10;can do these things.&#10;&#10;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny&#10;you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions&#10;translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the&#10;software, or if you modify it.&#10;&#10;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for&#10;a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must&#10;make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must&#10;show them these terms so they know their rights.&#10;&#10;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)&#10;offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute&#10;and/or modify the software.&#10;&#10;Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that&#10;everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the&#10;software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to&#10;know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced&#10;by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.&#10;&#10;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We&#10;wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will&#10;individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.&#10;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for&#10;everyone's free use or not licensed at all.&#10;&#10;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification&#10;follow.&#10;&#10;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#10;&#10;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice&#10;placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#10;this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program&#10;or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any&#10;derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the&#10;Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or&#10;translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included&#10;without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as&#10;&quot;you&quot;.&#10;&#10;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by&#10;this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is&#10;not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents&#10;constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by&#10;running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#10;&#10;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as&#10;you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#10;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#10;disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License&#10;and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the&#10;Program a copy of this License along with the Program.&#10;&#10;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may&#10;at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#10;&#10;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus&#10;forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications&#10;or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of&#10;these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating&#10;    that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#10;&#10;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or&#10;    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be&#10;    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of&#10;    this License.&#10;&#10;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,&#10;    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the&#10;    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an&#10;    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or&#10;    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute&#10;    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy&#10;    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does&#10;    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is&#10;    not required to print an announcement.)&#10;&#10;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable&#10;sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably&#10;considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and&#10;its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate&#10;works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a&#10;work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms&#10;of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#10;whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#10;&#10;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your&#10;rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the&#10;right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on&#10;the Program.&#10;&#10;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the&#10;Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or&#10;distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this&#10;License.&#10;&#10;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under&#10;Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and&#10;2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source&#10;    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#10;    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to&#10;    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically&#10;    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the&#10;    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1&#10;    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to&#10;    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only&#10;    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in&#10;    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with&#10;    Subsection b above.)&#10;&#10;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making&#10;modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all&#10;the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface&#10;definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation&#10;of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code&#10;distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either&#10;source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#10;of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#10;itself accompanies the executable.&#10;&#10;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy&#10;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source&#10;code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though&#10;third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#10;&#10;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as&#10;expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,&#10;sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate&#10;your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or&#10;rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so&#10;long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&#10;However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program&#10;or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not&#10;accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or&#10;any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to&#10;do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#10;the Program or works based on it.&#10;&#10;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),&#10;the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to&#10;copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.&#10;You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the&#10;rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by&#10;third parties to this License.&#10;&#10;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#10;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions&#10;are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that&#10;contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the&#10;conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#10;simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent&#10;obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.&#10;For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution&#10;of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through&#10;you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#10;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#10;&#10;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#10;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and&#10;the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or&#10;other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this&#10;section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software&#10;distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many&#10;people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software&#10;distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#10;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to&#10;distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that&#10;choice.&#10;&#10;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a&#10;consequence of the rest of this License.&#10;&#10;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain&#10;countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original&#10;copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit&#10;geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that&#10;distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In&#10;such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body&#10;of this License.&#10;&#10;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the&#10;General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in&#10;spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems&#10;or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#10;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later&#10;version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of&#10;that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may&#10;choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;&#10;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs&#10;whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for&#10;permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#10;write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.&#10;Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of&#10;all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of&#10;software generally.&#10;&#10;NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR&#10;THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE&#10;STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE&#10;PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,&#10;INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND&#10;FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND&#10;PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,&#10;YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL&#10;ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE&#10;PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#10;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#10;INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA&#10;BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#10;FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER&#10;OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#10;&#10;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible&#10;use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software&#10;which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#10;&#10;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach&#10;them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion&#10;of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a&#10;pointer to where the full notice is found.&#10;&#10;    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&#10;&#10;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;&#10;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it&#10;    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free&#10;    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)&#10;    any later version.&#10;&#10;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT&#10;    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or&#10;    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for&#10;    more details.&#10;&#10;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#10;    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59&#10;    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA&#10;&#10;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#10;&#10;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it&#10;starts in an interactive mode:&#10;&#10;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes&#10;    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free&#10;    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;&#10;    type 'show c' for details.&#10;&#10;The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate&#10;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be&#10;called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be&#10;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#10;&#10;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,&#10;if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.  Here&#10;is a sample; alter the names:&#10;&#10;    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#10;    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#10;&#10;    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989&#10;&#10;    Ty Coon, President of Vice&#10;&#10;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#10;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#10;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#10;library.

Thus, the terms and conditions of&#10;    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.&#10;&#10;    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you&#10;    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an&#10;    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,&#10;    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your&#10;    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,&#10;    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent&#10;    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If&#10;    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of&#10;    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do&#10;    so, delete this exception statement from your version.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING&#10;&#10;Certain files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates are&#10;subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,&#10;based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the&#10;GNU Classpath Exception.&#10;&#10;Note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in this software&#10;package.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed&#10;incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.&#10;For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache&#10;License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed&#10;to you under their original licenses.&#10;&#10;Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the&#10;Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits&#10;you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not&#10;licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to&#10;commingle code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed&#10;code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also&#10;containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.&#10;&#10;Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the&#10;files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be&#10;required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under&#10;the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms&#10;of some items included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath&#10;Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further&#10;distribute the package.&#10;&#10;Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create&#10;unexpected legal consequences.&#10;&#10;Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer&#10;skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or&#10;making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed&#10;and/or involve the use of third party software." wrapText="true" VBox.vgrow="ALWAYS" />
